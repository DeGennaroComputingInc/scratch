A Jira issue ( AESEDI-53447) was logged that the customer data was not sent from AES EDI. 486,000 records were affected. The investigation showed that the file with the data was sent, but it did not get processed due to an issue with the AES CIS service (Jira Issue No: AESCIS-38263) at that point of time. The same issue affected EDI to CIS monitoring service working on the CIS side. So the missed records were not discovered automatically. The file was resent and the issue got resolved. The missing records were discovered at 11:56 AM, processed at 1:00 PM.
